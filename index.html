        <h3> <a href="https://simj113.github.io/project2/" target = "_blank">Elden Ring</a></h3>
            <p>This website was one of my first developments
               learning how to code with HTML and CSS. I thought it 
               would be fine to make a website inspired by a famous
               game and choose to make it thematically match the central idea 
               of elden ring.

        <h3> <a href="https://simj113.github.io/project3/" target = "_blank">Seattle</a></h3>
            <p>For my next website, I tried to go for a more professional look.
                Using more advanced CSS techniques such as grids and flex containers. 
                I was able to organize the information in a way that felt satisfying.

        <h3> <a href="https://simj113.github.io/GameWebsite/" target = "_blank">Nintendo</a></h3>
            <p>For my other project. I decided for a more fun and class outlook that was still aesthetically pleasing. The idea was to use retro game themes and text to provide a theme about the three best nintendo games in my opinion.
