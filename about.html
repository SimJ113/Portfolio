                    <p>My name is Joseph Sim and I am a prospective student that is looking to learn more about marketing. I have hobbies in making music and creating content. 
                    I also have experience in photography and have used that to make some of my content before. To the left is a photo that I took a while back of the suburb cityscape area in the snowy season.

            <h3>CSS Font Styling</h3>
            <p>Font Styling and text customization are crucial componenets in creating effective websites that engage the audience. Using basic fonts does not add the same effect of engagement that other fonts might have. My Nintendo Website uses creative retro fonts that speak both to the game theme and the viewers interest in the website design.</p>

            <h3>Working with Images</h3>
            <p>Images are essential in web design to create an aesthically pleasing website that is also able to effectively communicate the information clearly to the viewers without much effort. This class taught me how to use images to my benefit and organize them in such a way that makes websites more appealing and better to use.</p>

            <h3>Grid Design for Websites</h3>
            <p>The last concept that I want to cover is grid design. This might have been one of the most important concepts to my learning in this class. To organize most of the information in such a way that makes it easy for people to view requires Grid Design that only comes with certain functions in CSS. Learning those concepts helped me tremednously with Web Design.</p>
